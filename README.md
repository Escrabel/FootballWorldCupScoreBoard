# FootballWorldCupScoreBoard
I have taken some licenses:
1.- I have made the Score Board visible all time.
2.- The ordering date in case of the same score is updated both when starting a match and when updating its score (This was ambiguous in the requirements document).
3.- I have added an option to load a preset of matches that are in the example of the requirements document.
4.- The matches are identified by the HomeTeam-AwayTeam tuple, which means that the same team can appear in as many matches as desired on the ScoreBoard, but never with the same opposing team.
5.- The same match with inverted team's side is considered a different match.
6.- The name sof the teams are not case sensitive.
